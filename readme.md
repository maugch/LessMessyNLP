This is my attempt of make nlp simple.

Specifically alignment.

To run:
* start redis
* start worker.py
* start the server (python run.py)

compile the client and start it.

To run maligna you need to install it and modify the path inside the job directory.

You can add new jobs inside the job directory and in the jobs.json file

more to come.
